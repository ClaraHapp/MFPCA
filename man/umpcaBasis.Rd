\title{Calculate an uncorrelated multilinear principal component basis
representation for functional data on two-dimensional domains}
\usage{
umpcaBasis(funDataObject, npc)
}
\arguments{
\item{funDataObject}{An object of class \code{\link[funData]{funData}}
containing the observed functional data samples (here: images) for which
the UMPCA is to be calculated.}

\item{npc}{An integer, giving a prespecified value for the number of
  principal components.}
}
\value{
\item{scores}{A matrix of scores (coefficients) with dimension
  \code{N x k}, reflecting the weights for principal component in each
  observation.}  \item{B}{A matrix containing the scalar product of all pairs
  of basis functions.} \item{ortho}{Logical, set to \code{FALSE}, as basis
  functions are not orthonormal.} \item{functions}{A functional data object,
  representing the functional principal component basis functions.}
}
\description{
This function calculates an uncorrelated multilinear principal component
analyis (UMPCA) representation for functional data on two-dimensional
domains. In this case, the data can be interpreted as images with \code{S1 x
S2} pixels (assuming \code{nObsPoints(funDataObject)} = (S1, S2)), i.e. the
total observed data are represented as third order tensor of dimension
\code{N x S1 x S2}.  The UMPCA of a tensor of this kind is calculated via the
\link{UMPCA} function, which is an \code{R}-version of the analogous
functions in the
\url{UMPCA}{http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35432-uncorrelated-multilinear-principal-component-analysis--umpca-}
MATLAB toolbox by Haiping Lu (see references).
