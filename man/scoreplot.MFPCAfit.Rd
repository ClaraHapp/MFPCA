\title{Plot the Scores of a Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis}
\usage{
scoreplot.MFPCAfit(MFPCAobj, choices = 1:2, scale = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{MFPCAobj}{An object of class \code{MFPCAfit}, typically returned by the
\link{MFPCA} function.}

\item{choices}{The indices of the scores that should by displayed. Defaults 
to \code{1:2}, i.e. the scores corresponding to the two leading modes of 
variability in the data.}

\item{scale}{Logical. Should the scores be scaled by the estimated
eigenvalues to emphasize the proportions of total variance explained by the
components. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A bivariate plot of scores.
}
\description{
This function plots two scores of a multivariate functional principal 
component analysis for each observation.

# and calculate MFPCA (cf. MFPCA help)

# simulate data (one-dimensional domains)

# Plot the first two scores
scoreplot(PCA) # no scaling (default)
scoreplot(PCA, scaling = TRUE) # scale the scores by the first two eigenvalues
