\title{Calculate linear combinations of spline basis functions on two-dimensional
domains}
\usage{
splineFunction2D(scores, argvals, bs, m, k)

splineFunction2Dpen(scores, argvals, bs, m, k)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A matrix of dimension \code{N x K}, representing the \code{K}
scores (coefficients) for each of the \code{N} observations.}

\item{argvals}{A list containing a two numeric vectors, corresponding to the
x- and y-values, on which the functions should be defined.}

\item{bs}{A vector of character strings (or a single character), the type of
basis functions to be used. Please refer to \code{\link[mgcv]{te}} for a
list of possible basis functions.}

\item{m}{A numeric vector (or a single number), the order of the spline
basis. See \code{\link[mgcv]{s}} for details.}

\item{k}{A numeric vector (or a single number), the number of basis functions
  used.  See  \code{\link[mgcv]{s}} for details.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{funData} with \code{N} observations on the
  two-dimensional domain specified by \code{argvals}, corresponding to the
  linear combination of spline basis functions.
}
\description{
Given scores (coefficients), these functions calculate a linear combination
of spline tensor basis functions on two-dimensional domains based on the
\link[mgcv]{gam}/ \link[mgcv]{bam} functions in the \pkg{mgcv} package. See
Details.
}
\details{
If the scores have been calculated based on an unpenalized tensor spline
basis, the linear combination is computed based on the
\code{\link[mgcv{gam}]} functions ((\code{splineFunction2D})). If the scores
were obtained using penalization, the expansion is calculated via
\link[mgcv]{bam} (\code{splineFunction2Dpen}).
